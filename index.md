# About Me

**Hi, I am a PhD student in IDG/McGOVERN INSTITUTE, Tsinghua University.**

# <font color=red>News!</font> 
* **I dived into computational neuroscience field in 2023.**
* **I became an phD student in 2022.**

# Education

### - Ph.D in Computational Neuroscience
#### _2022/09-2027/06 (expected)_
  * **Tsinghua University, Beijing**

### - Bachelor in Biotechnology and Computer Science (The second degree)
#### _2018/09-2022/06_
  * **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu**
 
# Interests

**My research interests include**

* **Internal Brain State**: How fundamental cognitive brain states are encoded in the brain and how these internal states interactive with sensory inputs to elicit specific behaviors.
* **Dynamic Neural Network**: Mechanisms of dynamic brain network and how cognition emerges in dynamic network.
* **NeuroAI Research**: Study the brain to learn how to build artificial general intelligence.


# Learning Notes 
As a first-year doctoral student, learning new knowledge in the field is an important event. I record and share my learning notes, meetings and seminar notes in my [Computational Neuroscience Learning Notes](https://energetic-player-d0e.notion.site/Computation-Neuroscience-Learning-e6014d81cdad43e7b20f1d4b36cff4ae).

       <p><small><b> Office paper is an important category of paper products accounting for a quarter of the global annual paper consumption. However office waste 
        paper, such a high-quality renewable resource, cannot enter easily into the recycling system, and is completely idle or waste. To solve this, we build a bio-
        deinking system to do environmentally friendly enzymatical deinking. Additionally, to complete the recycling directly in which the waste paper is produced, we 
        builded a hardware device (Deinker) that can realize automatically paper recycling and deinking in the office.</small></p>
