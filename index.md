# 💯 Learning Notes 
As a first-year doctoral student, learning new knowledge in the field is an important event. I record and share my learning notes, meetings and seminar notes in my [Computational Neuroscience Learning Notes](https://energetic-player-d0e.notion.site/Computation-Neuroscience-Learning-e6014d81cdad43e7b20f1d4b36cff4ae).

# 💗 Lifes and hobbies
Although I am a doctoral student, I hope to become a vibrant person. From time to time, I would go out to take photos or be the subject of the shoot. Currently, I am studying diving, fencing, and fitness. Click here to see photos in [Zoey's Club](https://www.notion.so/Colorful-Life-and-Hobbies-3adaeba927344b9891c90acd84e88dbc).

       <p><small><b> Office paper is an important category of paper products accounting for a quarter of the global annual paper consumption. However office waste 
        paper, such a high-quality renewable resource, cannot enter easily into the recycling system, and is completely idle or waste. To solve this, we build a bio-
        deinking system to do environmentally friendly enzymatical deinking. Additionally, to complete the recycling directly in which the waste paper is produced, we 
        builded a hardware device (Deinker) that can realize automatically paper recycling and deinking in the office.
